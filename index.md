Romulus and Remus were twins born to the war god Mars and Rhea Silvia, daughter of Nibitor, who was the king of the city Alba Longa. Nibitor was upsurped by his younger brother Amulius, who ordered the death of all the male heirs to Nibitor. The servant ordered to kill the twins, however, took pity on them; he put them in a basket and floated it down the Tiber River. It is said that the boys were found by a she-wolf named Lupa, who raised the boys.

As grown men, the twins were natural leaders and were able to kill Amulius, reinstating Nibitor as the old king. They then went off to find their own settlement, to the area of seven hills where they were found by Lupa. When each brother favored a different hill, they agreed to have an augury, examining birds to see what the gods favored. Remus claims to have observed six birds compared to Romulus's twelve, and a heated arguement arose. In the end, Romulus killed Remus, then naming the city after himself and becoming the first king of Rome.

# Analysis

##### While the story about the founding of Rome is obviously a myth, however, it is still important to analyze literature for overlooked details, as things aren't often **as they seem**.

>First, Romulus kills Remus after supposedly receiving the Gods' good omen, and familicide is one of the highest crimes with the worst punishments in Greek and Roman myths, like Hercules's twleve labors for killing his family and Cronus's curse for killing his father Uranus. Historically, the murder of family was also intolerable in Roman society, with one of the harshest punishments called *poena cullei* being reserved for those found guilty of parricide. The accused is beaten, sown in a sack with live animals, and thrown in a river to drown, symbolizing that they are less than animals. 

>Another point is that though the twins are both children of Mars, and to kill a demigod is often punished by the parent, for instance the case of Halirrhothius, a son of Poseidon who tried to violate Aglaulus, daughter of Ares. Ares then descended to Earth to violently kill Halirrhothius. Though Mars (the Roman name for Ares) likely wouldn't kill another one of his children after witnessing the death of one, the murder likely would not go unpunished. 

>While it may seem like the story ends with the founding of Rome, 37 years later, Romulus was said to have disappeared in a storm during battle; stories vary between an assassination to him taken by Mars. 

>Historically, a man named Romulus was responsible for the founding for the city of Rome, but the addition of Remus was only in the myths.

>According to Daly et al. in "Siblicide and Senority", there is a tendency for the killer to be younger when the victim and killer are of the same gender. 

# Conclusion

With all the evidence gathered, the final step is to connect the dots to draw the picture. Romulus and Remus are twins, meaning they look the same. Romulus had no reason to attack Remus, as Remus lost the augury; but Remus had the sake of the location of his city on the line. It is possible that younger siblings are jealous of the older one for always learning things before them, so the grudge may be even drawn out, not to mention the statistical evidence that suggests younger siblings are more likely to kill their older ones when both are of the same gender, checking multiple boxes for Romulus and Remus. 

The idea proposed is that Romulus did not kill Remus, but the other way around. Jealous that his brother bested him, Remus killed Romulus in anger. From there, he went on to take Romulus's identity to escape the guilt with a new identity. Remus did not lead the city well, making one bad decision after another such as kidnapping the Sabine women, leading to the Sabine wars. These wars caught the attention of Mars, the god of war, who realizes that the leader on one side is his murderous son Remus, and finally punished him. 

These claims aren't baseless, with speculations of such arounsing in the minds of other Roman thinkers and writers. One such instance was Plutarch.
